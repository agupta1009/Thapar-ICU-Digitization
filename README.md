# Thapar-ICU-Digitization
Working as a team in Thapar Univ. to create an ICU digitization system for a hospital in Patiala to minimize the use of Pen/Paper and speed up the observation process.

The main focus is to create a voice-guided system which will include everything from recording patient's conditions to something very specific like it's diet chart.
