A team project in Thapar Univ. to create an ICU digitization system for a hospital in Patiala to minimize the use of Pen/Paper and speed up the observation process.

The USP of the project is bsically a voice-guided system which will include everything from recording patient's conditions to something very specific like it's diet chart.


## Back End 
We are using an apache server on the backend that'll host the Web Applicaiton we have created [here][1]. This Website is a dashboard for the doctors as well as nurses to access the details of every ICU patient
